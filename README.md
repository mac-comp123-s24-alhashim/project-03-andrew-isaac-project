# Hangman
Team members: Isaac Powers, Andrew Dong <br>
Short description: A game where you have 7 chances to guess letters one-by-one in a phrase, otherwise you will be ‘hung’ <br>
Why you choose this project: It’s a project that implements both text-based input and guessing, as well as turtle-based drawing of a man. <br>
Inspiration: The real-life game hangman, usually played on a whiteboard Implementation and responsibility plan, ie, what needs to be 
accomplished, who will do what when.  

# How to play
To begin, run the program and a turtle/tkinter window should open. <br>
The program will automatically pick a word and draw as many spaces for each character. Just type your guess and press enter to confirm. 
<br>
If the guess is wrong, your 'errors remaining' count will decrease, and one body part will be drawn. Otherwise if you are right, your 
guess <br> will be filled in for all the lines it is present in the word. 
<br> Keep guessing new letters until you either run out of guesses or complete the word. Good luck!
<br><br>Requirements <br>
Requires Python 3.12, turtle and pillow/tkinter packages
